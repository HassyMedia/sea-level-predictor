# sea-level-predictor

Overview

This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing the change in global average sea level since 1880. Utilizing Python with Pandas and Matplotlib, the project predicts future changes in sea level through the year 2050.

Data Description

The dataset, sourced from epa-sea-level.csv, contains historical data on global average sea level changes from 1880 up to recent years. This data is crucial for understanding long-term trends in sea level rise.

Key Features

Analysis of historical sea level change data.
Scatter plot visualization to observe trends over time.
Linear regression to estimate future changes in sea level.
Prediction of sea level changes up to the year 2050.

Visualization

A scatter plot showing the historical data of sea level changes.
Lines of best fit to project future trends based on historical data.
Separate predictive analysis based on data since 2000 to compare recent trends with long-term patterns.

How to Run

Ensure Python, Pandas, and Matplotlib are installed. Run sea_level_predictor.py to import the data, perform the analysis, and generate visualizations.

Requirements

Python 3
Pandas
Matplotlib
